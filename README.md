### Christmas Spending

**Group Members:** Nicole Kim, Teressa Ross, Sierra Moon, Betty Huynh

We decided that we would continue the project that we did on spending expenditure of gifts for Christmas. We are going to expand on secondary information that would have an important role in influencing the expenditure. We each would research and create our own approaches to each factor. Then we would come all together to unify the information and create a narrative to display the data.
